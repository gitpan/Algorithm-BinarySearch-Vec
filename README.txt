NAME
    README for Algorithm::BinarySearch::Vec - binary search for
    vec()-vectors

DESCRIPTION
    The Algorithm::BinarySearch::Vec perl module provides binary search
    functions for vec()-vectors, including fast XS implementations, which
    are used by default if available.

INSTALLATION
  Building from Source
    To build and install the entire package, issue the following commands to
    the shell:

     bash$ cd PACKAGE-X.YY       # (or wherever you unpacked this distribution)
     bash$ perl Makefile.PL      # configure the package
     bash$ make                  # build the package
     bash$ make test             # test the build (optional)a
     bash$ make install          # install the package on your system

    More details on the top-level installation process can be found in the
    perlmodinstall(1) manpage.
